    "This notebook implements a reproducible workflow for predicting protein binding pockets using sequence data aligned with BioLiP annotations. The goal is to generate residue‑level pocket masks and train neural network models that can classify each amino acid as part of a binding site or not.  \n",

    "We compare two approaches:\n",
    "- **Simple Tokenizer + Feedforward Neural Network**: a lightweight model using a custom amino acid vocabulary.\n",
    "- **ProtBERT Tokenizer + Transformer Head**: leveraging pretrained embeddings for protein sequences.\n",

    "The workflow includes:\n",
    "1. Loading protein sequences and BioLiP annotations  \n",
    "2. Aligning sequences to generate binding pocket masks  \n",
    "3. Tokenizing sequences (simple vs ProtBERT)  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Canonical ID normalization**: Ensures consistent identifiers for PDB entries and chain IDs (e.g., `1abc_A` → `1abc_a`).\n",

    "- **BioLiP parsing**: Reads compressed BioLiP annotations, extracts binding residues from column 9, and converts them into 0‑based indices.\n",
    "- **Label generation**: For each protein sequence, creates a binary mask (`0` = non‑binding, `1` = binding) aligned to the sequence length.\n",
    "- **Dataset assembly**: Writes labeled sequences to `biolip_labeled.txt` in a 3‑line format (`>id`, sequence, label mask), then reloads them into memory as `(sequence, labels)` pairs.\n",
    "- **Debug statistics**: Prints counts of parsed sequences, annotated chains, overlapping IDs, and basic sanity checks (sequence length vs. label length, number of binding residues).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **ROC computation**:\n",
    "  - Uses `roc_curve` to compute false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) for both models.  \n",
    "  - Calculates **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** for each ROC curve, summarizing overall discriminative ability.\n",

    "This visualization provides a clear comparison of how well each model separates pocket vs. non‑pocket residues, highlighting the improvement ProtBERT offers over the simpler baseline."

    "This visualization provides a **side‑by‑side summary** of overall discriminative power (AUC) and optimal precision/recall balance (F1), making it easy to compare the baseline and ProtBERT models at a glance."
