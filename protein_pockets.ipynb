    "This notebook implements a reproducible workflow for predicting protein binding pockets using sequence data aligned with BioLiP annotations. The goal is to generate residue‑level pocket masks and train neural network models that can classify each amino acid as part of a binding site or not.  \n",

    "We compare two approaches:\n",
    "- **Simple Tokenizer + Feedforward Neural Network**: a lightweight model using a custom amino acid vocabulary.\n",
    "- **ProtBERT Tokenizer + Transformer Head**: leveraging pretrained embeddings for protein sequences.\n",

    "The workflow includes:\n",
    "1. Loading protein sequences and BioLiP annotations  \n",
    "2. Aligning sequences to generate binding pocket masks  \n",
    "3. Tokenizing sequences (simple vs ProtBERT)  \n",

    "This section prepares the dataset by combining protein sequences from FASTA files with binding site annotations from the BioLiP database. The workflow includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Canonical ID normalization**: Ensures consistent identifiers for PDB entries and chain IDs (e.g., `1abc_A` → `1abc_a`).\n",
    "- **FASTA parsing**: Reads compressed FASTA sequences and extracts protein chains into a dictionary keyed by canonical IDs.\n",
    "- **BioLiP parsing**: Reads compressed BioLiP annotations, extracts binding residues from column 9, and converts them into 0‑based indices.\n",
    "- **Label generation**: For each protein sequence, creates a binary mask (`0` = non‑binding, `1` = binding) aligned to the sequence length.\n",
    "- **Dataset assembly**: Writes labeled sequences to `biolip_labeled.txt` in a 3‑line format (`>id`, sequence, label mask), then reloads them into memory as `(sequence, labels)` pairs.\n",
    "- **Debug statistics**: Prints counts of parsed sequences, annotated chains, overlapping IDs, and basic sanity checks (sequence length vs. label length, number of binding residues).\n",

    "This preprocessing step produces a reproducible dataset that can be used for training and evaluating binding pocket prediction models."

    "## PocketPredictorLogits: Logit-Based Model Variant\n",
    "\n",
    "This section defines a variant of the **PocketPredictor** neural network that outputs raw logits instead of probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**:\n",
    "  - **Embedding layer**: Maps amino acid indices into dense vectors of dimension 64.  \n",
    "  - **Fully connected layers**:  \n",
    "    - First linear layer projects embeddings into a hidden dimension of 256.  \n",
    "    - ReLU activation introduces non‑linearity.  \n",
    "    - Second linear layer reduces hidden features to a single output per residue.  \n",
    "  - **Output**: Produces raw logits of shape `[batch, seq_len]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key difference from PocketPredictor**:\n",
    "  - This version does **not** apply a sigmoid activation in the forward pass.  \n",
    "  - Logits can later be converted into probabilities using `torch.sigmoid` during training or evaluation.  \n",
    "  - This design is often preferred for stability when using loss functions like `BCEWithLogitsLoss`, which internally applies the sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This logit‑based variant provides more flexibility for training and evaluation, especially when experimenting with different loss functions or calibration strategies."

    "- **Range checks**:\n",
    "  - Prints the minimum and maximum values of each prediction array.  \n",
    "  - Ensures that predicted probabilities fall within a valid range (close to 0–1 after sigmoid).  \n",
    "  - Helps detect anomalies such as logits mistakenly used instead of probabilities, or misaligned outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**:\n",
    "  - Validates that evaluation metrics are computed on correctly shaped and scaled arrays.  \n",
    "  - Provides quick diagnostic feedback before deeper analysis (ROC‑AUC, precision/recall sweeps, top‑k evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "This step ensures that both the baseline and ProtBERT models produce **well‑formed probability distributions** aligned with the ground truth, preventing silent errors in downstream evaluation."

    "## Optimal Threshold Search for Best F1 Score\n",
    "\n",
    "This section scans probability thresholds to identify the **optimal operating point** for each model based on the F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function `best_f1`**:\n",
    "  - Iterates over thresholds between 0.05 and 0.95 (step = 0.05).  \n",
    "  - Converts predicted probabilities into binary pocket/non‑pocket predictions at each threshold.  \n",
    "  - Computes the **F1 score** (harmonic mean of precision and recall).  \n",
    "  - Tracks the highest F1 score and the threshold at which it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation**:\n",
    "  - Runs `best_f1` for both:\n",
    "    - **Simple NN baseline** (`y_pred_probs_simple`).  \n",
    "    - **ProtBERT-Pocket head** (`y_pred_probs_prot`).  \n",
    "  - Prints the best F1 score and corresponding threshold for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:\n",
    "  - The optimal threshold balances precision and recall for residue‑level pocket prediction.  \n",
    "  - Comparing best F1 scores shows which model achieves stronger balance.  \n",
    "  - The threshold values reveal how conservative or aggressive each model must be to maximize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step provides a **threshold‑optimized comparison** of the simple baseline and ProtBERT‑Pocket, complementing ROC‑AUC and top‑k evaluations by focusing on the precision/recall trade‑off at the best operating point."
